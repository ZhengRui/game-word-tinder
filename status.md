## üìù **Development Notes**
- **Running the app**: Requires two terminals
  - Terminal 1: `bun run socket-server` (Socket.io server on port 3001)
  - Terminal 2: `bun dev` (Next.js app on port 3000)
- **Testing**: Open `/display` on main screen, `/play` on mobile devices
- **Real-time features**: Player registration, team updates, connection status all working
- **Deployment**: Current setup requires external Socket.io hosting for production (Vercel + Railway/Render)

## üéØ **Ready for Phase 2**
The real-time foundation is complete and tested. Next phase: Word Card Management System.

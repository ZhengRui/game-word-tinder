# Word Tinder - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Basic Project Setup
- Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Bun package manager configuration
- Socket.io dependencies installed
- Custom favicon with microphone icon
- Project structure with routing (`/`, `/display`, `/play`)

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Visual Layout
- **Home page** with navigation to Display and Play modes
- **Display page** (`/display`) - Main screen layout:
  - Left half: Word card display with topic and keywords
  - Right half: Team displays with member status indicators
  - Mock data showing teams, scores, and player states
- **Play page** (`/play`) - Mobile interface:
  - Team registration form
  - Current word card preview
  - Large claim button
  - Status indicators (available/cooldown)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** - Core Game Mechanics
- **Registration system**: UI exists but not connected to backend
- **Team management**: Static display, no real-time updates
- **Word card claiming**: Button exists but no server communication
- **Basic Socket.io setup**: Route exists but incomplete implementation

## ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Real-time Game Logic
1. **Word Card System**:
   - Random word card generation
   - 10-second auto-skip timer
   - Card database/content management

2. **Claiming Mechanism**:
   - Real-time claim processing (first-come-first-served)
   - Claim validation and conflict resolution
   - Player state updates

3. **Timer Systems**:
   - 1-minute speech countdown
   - 3-minute cooldown timers
   - Auto-progression between states

4. **Game State Management**:
   - Active game sessions
   - Player registration backend
   - Team score tracking
   - Game flow orchestration

5. **Transitions & Visual Effects**:
   - 3-2-1 countdown transitions
   - Card flip animations
   - State change visual feedback

## ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Advanced Features
1. **Scoring System**:
   - Point calculation and storage
   - Bonus point mechanics
   - Final scoring and winner determination

2. **Optional Features**:
   - Live leaderboard updates
   - Sound effects for transitions
   - Funny/surprise card types
   - Audience voting system

## üéØ **NEXT PRIORITY TASKS**
1. Complete Socket.io server implementation
2. Implement real-time player registration
3. Add word card management system
4. Build claiming mechanism with conflict resolution
5. Add timer systems for speech and cooldown

## üìù **Notes**
The foundation is solid with good UI/UX, but the core real-time game mechanics need to be implemented to make it functional.

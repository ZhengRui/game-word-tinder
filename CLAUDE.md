This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Word Tinder** is a real-time multiplayer word game for Toastmasters meetings where teams compete to claim word prompts and deliver impromptu speeches. The game runs for 15 minutes with teams claiming words, giving 1-minute speeches, and earning points.

## Architecture

### Dual-Server Setup
This project requires **two servers running simultaneously**:
- **Next.js App** (port 3000): UI, routing, static content
- **Socket.io Server** (port 3001): Real-time game state and WebSocket communication

### Development Commands
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Socket.io server
bun run socket-server

# Terminal 2 - Next.js app  
bun dev

# Build
bun run build
```

### Key URLs
- **Main Display**: `http://localhost:3000/display` (for projector/large screen)
- **Player Interface**: `http://localhost:3000/play` (for mobile devices)

## Real-time Communication

### Socket.io Architecture
- **Server**: `socket-server.js` - Standalone Socket.io server with CORS for localhost
- **Client Hook**: `src/hooks/useSocket.ts` - Custom React hook managing Socket.io connection
- **Game State**: Centralized server-side state broadcasted to all clients on changes

### Key Socket Events
- `register-player` - Player joins team
- `reconnect-player` - Player reconnects with session token
- `claim-word` - Player attempts to claim current word card
- `update-config` - Admin updates game configuration
- `game-state-update` - Server broadcasts state to all clients
- `registration-error` / `claim-error` / `config-error` / `reconnection-error` - Error handling

### Game State Structure
```typescript
{
  players: Player[];  // All registered players
  teams: Record<string, { members: string[], score: number }>; // Dynamic teams based on config
  config: GameConfig; // Configurable game settings
  currentCard: any;    // Current word card
  gamePhase: 'waiting' | 'card-display' | 'speaking' | 'speech-paused' | 'cooldown';
  currentSpeaker: string | null;
}
```

## Interface Architecture

### Two Primary Interfaces
1. **Display Interface** (`/display`): Large screen showing game state, teams, current card
2. **Player Interface** (`/play`): Mobile-optimized for player registration and interactions

### UI Patterns
- **Dark theme**: Gray-900 backgrounds throughout
- **Team colors**: Red (Team A), Blue (Team B), Green (Team C)
- **Status indicators**: ‚úì (available), üé§ (speaking), ‚è± (cooldown), üì± (disconnected)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 Complete
- **Real-time Foundation**: Player registration, team tracking, connection management
- **Word Card System**: 30 Toastmasters topics with random selection (word-cards.js)
- **Configurable Timers**: Auto-skip cards with customizable display time
- **Claiming Mechanism**: Real-time first-come-first-served claiming with validation
- **Speech Timer System**: Configurable countdown starting when player claims topic
- **Cooldown System**: Configurable individual cooldown timers for players after speaking
- **Auto-Transitions**: Automatic progression between game phases (claim ‚Üí speak ‚Üí cooldown ‚Üí available)
- **Speaker Management**: Clear identification of who claimed (name + team display)
- **Disconnect Handling**: Proper cleanup when speaking player disconnects/refreshes
- **Admin Controls**: Start Game, Next Card, Stop Game, Configure buttons on display interface
- **Timer Displays**: Real-time countdown timers on both mobile and display interfaces
- **Button States**: Claim buttons properly disabled with countdown during cooldown
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layouts with fixed-height containers
- **Scoring System**: Complete team scoring with configurable points per speech and bonus
- **Bonus Points**: Star buttons for creativity awards during cooldown periods
- **Winner Determination**: Automatic winner detection with tie handling
- **Game End Modal**: Final scores display with winner announcement
- **Game Configuration System**: Complete customizable settings with validation
  - Configurable number of teams (2-6, default: 2)
  - Configurable topic display time (5-60s, default: 10s)  
  - Adjustable speech duration (30-300s, default: 60s)
  - Variable cooldown period (60-600s, default: 120s)
  - Customizable speech points (1-10, default: 2)
  - Configurable bonus points (1-5, default: 1)
  - Dynamic team generation based on configuration
  - Real-time configuration updates with input validation
- **Speech Pause/Resume System**: Robust disconnect handling for speaking players
  - Session-based reconnection with localStorage tokens
  - Automatic speech timer pause when speaking player disconnects
  - Speech resume from exact remaining time when player reconnects
  - 2-minute reconnection window with automatic abandonment
  - Admin control to skip paused speeches and continue game
  - Visual indicators for paused state and disconnected players
  - Proper status restoration for all player types after reconnection

### üìã Phase 7+ Optional Features (Not Planned)
- Enhanced visual transitions and sound effects
- Live leaderboard updates and audience voting system
- Game session analytics and reporting

## Development Notes

### File Structure
- `socket-server.js` - Standalone Socket.io server (not in src/)
- `src/app/display/page.tsx` - Main display interface
- `src/app/play/page.tsx` - Mobile player interface  
- `src/hooks/useSocket.ts` - Socket.io client management
- `game_design.md` - Complete game rules and mechanics
- `TODO.md` - Detailed implementation roadmap

### Deployment Considerations
- **Development**: Both servers run locally
- **Production**: Requires separate hosting
  - Next.js app ‚Üí Vercel (recommended)
  - Socket.io server ‚Üí Railway/Render/Heroku
- **CORS**: Currently configured for localhost only

### Testing
- Manual testing by running both servers and opening display + mobile interfaces
- No automated test suite currently implemented

## Game Design Context

Read `game_design.md` for complete game mechanics. Key points:
- 15-minute session with multiple rounds
- Teams compete to claim word prompts first
- 1-minute speeches with 3-minute cooldown periods
- Scoring based on successful claims and speech delivery
- Visual countdown timers and transitions between game phases
